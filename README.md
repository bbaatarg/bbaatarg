### 👋 Hey there! I'm Bay

Senior iOS wizard 🧙‍♂️ turning coffee into code since 2012. Currently crafting delightful mobile experiences in Australia 🦘

🎯 What I do:
- Build awesome iOS apps that people love to use
- Make pixels dance with Swift & Flutter
- Turn complex problems into elegant solutions
- Mentor fellow developers on their coding journey

🛠 Tech I love:
Swift • SwiftUI • Flutter • Objective-C • Firebase • AWS

💡 Fun fact: I helped build Mongolia's #1 food delivery app! When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new tech, mentoring developers, or dreaming up the next big app idea.
